# Symmetric-encryption

1. Key generation

To generate a key run keygen.py.
The key will be stored in 'Key' folder


2. Encryption

Save the key you want to use for encryption in 'Key' folder (skip if you generated the key)
Save all message files as .txt files in the 'Messages' folder
Run encrypt.py

Remark: This works for multiple files at the same time

Run decrypt.py
The decrypted messages will be in 'Decrypted-messages' folder.
